## Overview
Shortcut uses [OpenAI public API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/), so you can communicate with text or voice using Siri. Now our Siri has finally become intelligent and can talk to us fluently! And all this can be done with just a Shortcut and an API key.

## Preparation
Before starting the configuration, make sure that you have completed all the items listed below.

- Ensure that the network can access the domain name https://api.openai.com.
- Ensure that there is enough balance in the API account: https://platform.openai.com/account/usage.
- Use Siri to start the shortcut: open Settings -> Siri & Search -> Siri Responses -> Check ‚ÄúAlways Show Speech‚Äù to see if recognition is accurate. Ensure that Siri‚Äôs language setting matches the language you are using.
- For correct work continuous conversations, you need to turn on the ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù -> Apple ID -> iCloud -> iCloud Drive function to use the save to TXT file function.

## Usage

Start the ‚ÄúShortcut‚Äù with Siri. Just say ‚ÄúHey, Siri, ChatGPT‚Äù, and then you can start chatting. Now you have a very smart Siri üòÜ Enjoy!

If you don‚Äôt like the name, you can rename the shortcut, and then chat with Siri by saying ‚ÄúHey, Siri, xxx‚Äù (xxx is the new name you chose). It‚Äôs better not to add special symbols to the name, as it‚Äôs hard to read them üòÇ. If Siri cannot match the shortcut name, it won‚Äôt work!

Of course, you can run the ChatGPT shortcut directly without Siri: you just need to open the Shortcuts app and run ChatGPT. At this time, it is used as a dialog box, and it will not be read out. You can add it to your Home Screen for quick access. Check how to do it in [my video tutorial](https://youtu.be/XH_RXfOJv9o).

### Advanced usage
This Shortcut works on iPhone, iPad, and macOS. It supports continuous conversations, quit chat, and new chat. Use it this way:

- The default is to support continuous dialogue, which can record context and discuss issues continuously.
- If you want to start a new chat, say ‚ÄúNew chat‚Äù when it‚Äôs your turn, and Siri will begin a new chat, which means that the previous context and conversation will be lost.
- If you want to quit ChatGPT to use the system‚Äôs Siri, you can say ‚ÄúQuit chat‚Äù on your turn. You can also close Siri directly and then re-open it, but it is more natural to provide the command to exit.
